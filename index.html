                    This is my first design for the True/False film fest poster, this is a clean and simple design that is easy to read. It uses bold fonts to grab the viewer and uses the same red as the one used on both their logo and their website. I also included their social media accounts below, this way if the viewer wishes to, they can find out more information about the event or even follow the event online.

                <h4>
                    This is my second attempt at a poster. This time, I orientated this one landscape, I believe this allowed me to spread everything else out more horizontally. The background colour is the same colour as used in the logo. I also wrapped the date around the page repeating it as it went around. I feel as if this fits well with the design, almost acting as a margin to the page. Instead of using a normal forward-slash, I drew my own one as this fits the page a lot better.

                <h4>
                    This poster was my final and favourite design. Like poster number 2, I stuck with landscape as I believe it gives me a lot more freedom to make an exciting poster. Firstly, I used Adobe Illustrator to create the mountain range you can see in the poster using the pen tool, I then used this as the background. Like the 2nd poster, I used the same font and layout for the main title. I wrapped some of the text around what is the sun in the poster and some next to the title, aswell as placing the date and website on the mountains.

                We were challenged to create 8 different photos for each type of typographical system using illustrator. Each system has its own seperate poster showing the differences between them, making these also helped create my Carp posters.

            <div> <h4> Axial: This involves one or more axis that the text follows and orientates itself around. Most of the time, it can be symmentrical, but as you can see here mine is not.</h4> </div>
            <div> <h4> Bilateral: Bilateral designs are all over the place, nothing is symmetrical or centred, they end up looking like a big mess of text on a poster. On mine I wrote 3 different paragraphs and aligned them all differently.</h4> </div>
            <div> <h4> Dilatational: Dilatational is designs using type set along circular paths, the text forms curves around a point. The text can also start wrapping a long one circle and then move a long to another.</h4> </div>
            <div> <h4> Grid: Grid is pretty self explanatory. You design the layout of your page with a grid template with columns and/or rows. Even though you have to stick with the certain rules in the grid you can still be quite creative with it.</h4> </div>
            <div> <h4> Modular: Modular uses repeated shapes to create a structure for your design. This gives you a lot more freedom compared to the likes of a grid layout. You are also not restricted to one axal.            </h4> </div>
            <div> <h4> Radial: Radial is similar to Dilatational, but the text can follow around more than one different circle. </h4> </div>
            <div> <h4> Random: Random is in the name, place all the text in very random places, doesn't matter whether it is ledgible or not, the point of it being random is that it is all over the place.</h4> </div>
            <div> <h4> Transitional: Transitional is text which follows very random lines, usaully towards the same direction or close to it, almost like waves.</h4> </div>

                This is a nice and easy to use website. There is enough white space so that it does not feel cramped or not too much is happening. My users are going to be either lecturers marking the work or other students who are taking graphic and web design aswell, this is why I have displayed all my work in quite large images as then its easy for the reader to view these in detail. My anchor points allow the user to quickly and easily navigate the page to where they need to go or where they would like to see, this is from the navigation bar at the top with the 5 buttons on it.

                With the combination of HTML and CSS, I have been able to create a good website that I will use to present my work. For certain things like the button links and the grid layout on the Typography Task, I used some webpages which I have referenced in an external file.
