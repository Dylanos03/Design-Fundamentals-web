                    This is my first design for the True/False film fest poster, this is a clean and simple design that is easy to read. It uses bold fonts to grab the viewer and uses the same red as the one used on both their logo and their website. I also included their social media accounts below, this way if the viewer wishes to, they can find out more information about the event or even follow the event online.

                </h4>

            <div id="TFRef2" class="TFRef2">
                <img class="TrueFalse2" src="images/TFPoster2.png">
                <h4>
                    This is my second attempt at a poster. This time, I orientated this one landscape, I believe this allowed me to spread everything else out more horizontally. The background colour is the same colour as used in the logo. I also wrapped the date around the page repeating it as it went around. I feel as if this fits well with the design, almost acting as a margin to the page. Instead of using a normal forward-slash, I drew my own one as this fits the page a lot better.
